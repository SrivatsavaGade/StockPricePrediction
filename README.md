One of the key challenges in predicting stock prices is dealing with the inherent unpredictability of the financial markets. Stock prices can be affected by a wide range of factors, from economic indicators to geopolitical events to unexpected news from a company or industry. These factors can be difficult to anticipate and can cause sudden and dramatic changes in stock prices.

To address these challenges, machine learning models have emerged as a promising tool for predicting stock prices. These models use historical stock data to identify patterns and trends that can help predict future price movements. However, it's important to note that no model can predict stock prices with perfect accuracy, and there will always be some degree of uncertainty and risk involved in investing in the stock market.

One popular machine learning model for predicting stock prices is Prophet, which is used in this app. Prophet is a time series forecasting model developed by Facebook that is designed to handle seasonality and other features of time series data. It works by decomposing a time series into its underlying trend, seasonality, and noise components, and then using this information to make predictions about future values.

In this app, users can select from a range of popular stocks and specify how many years they want to predict stock prices for. The app then uses yfinance to download historical stock data and Prophet to generate a forecast for future prices. The app also includes visualizations of the raw data and the forecast, which can help users better understand the trends and patterns in the data.

While machine learning models like Prophet can be a useful tool for predicting stock prices, it's important to remember that they are not a crystal ball. No model can accurately predict every movement in the stock market, and investing in the stock market always carries some degree of risk. Additionally, it's important to do your own research and analysis before making any investment decisions, and to consult with a financial advisor if you are unsure about any aspects of investing.
